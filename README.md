Privacy remains a priority in any computational systems, circuits and programs for the properfunctioning and security of any organization. This basic necessity is at treat when a seemingly harmless trojan attacks the system. These attacks, in the form of malicious modifications of electronic hardware at different stages of its life cycle, pose major security concerns in the electronics industry.In this project we are analyzing a complex circuit to find out the low transition probability pointwhere trojan could have been inserted  in the circuit. Low transition point refers to the points inthe circuit where activity is less than a certain predefined threshold. Low activity in this region makes the trojan circuit difficult to detect. Thus the purpose of trojan, i.e to remain undetected inthe circuit and cause harm, is satisfied. We will be placing such a circuit at this low transition probability points, such the transition probability at this points increases and trojan inclusion by attackers become difficult or trojan is detected if present in the circuit.
